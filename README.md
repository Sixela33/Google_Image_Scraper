# Google_Image_Scraper

A program that gets images from google and gives a Human opeartor the choice to pick a label for later use

Made this application to have a way to scrape and lable images from google. I had to use selenium so the application could access images from the search engine because it gives me the posibiility of executing Javascript code that lets the app load more images to Download.

The application is devided into 2 parts, the download phase and the labeling one, this gives the user the possibility to download the images and label them at sepparate times, that's why the functions are being called in the Notebook.
